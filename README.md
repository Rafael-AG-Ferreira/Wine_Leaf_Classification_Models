# Wine_Leaf_Classification_Models
Wine Tree Classification from Leaves

Exploratory work with the objective of understanding image classification work
and how changing parameters (extra class for data consolidation or dataset background removal)
influences the developed models.

For each hypothesis the data obtained were (best epoch means lower loss values):

    #1 -> 	Transfer Learning Best Epoch    -> 60
            Fine Tunning Best Epoch         -> 32
                Transfer Learning Max Epoch -> 99
                Fine Tunning Max Epoch      -> 99

    #2 -> 	Transfer Learning Best Epoch    -> 65
            Fine Tunning Best Epoch         -> 87
            Transfer Learning Max Epoch     -> 99
            Fine Tunning Max Epoch          -> 99

    #3 -> 	Transfer Learning Best Epoch    -> 77
            Fine Tunning Best Epoch         -> 78
            Transfer Learning Max Epoch     -> 99
            Fine Tunning Max Epoch          -> 99

    #4 -> 	Transfer Learning Best Epoch    -> 88
            Fine Tunning Best Epoch         -> 73
            Transfer Learning Max Epoch     -> 99
            Fine Tunning Max Epoch          -> 99
